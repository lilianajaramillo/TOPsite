	<h1>Twenty One Pilots Lyrics Sample</h1>
	<h2>Ode to Sleep</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy,
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing,
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling,
Then I feel my soul start leaving, like an old man's hair receding,
I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking,
Why it's got to be like this. Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands,
I'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness,
			Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Song</h2>		
	<ul>
		<li>I don't know why, I just feel I'm better off,
Staying in the same room I was born in,
I look outside, and see a whole world better off,
Without me in it trying to transform it,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Listen, I know this one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds,
But the lyrics are so down,
It's OK though, because it represents, wait better yet, it is,
Who I feel I am right now,

You are out of my mind, you aren't seeing my side,
You waste all this time trying to get to me,
But you are out of my mind,

Heard you say, "Not today."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a sound,
Heard your voice, "There's no choice."
Tore the curtains down, windows open now, make a noise,

Don't you test me though, just because I play the piano,
Doesn't mean I am not willing to take you down, I'm sorry

I'm, I'm out of my mind, I'm not seeing things right,
I waste all this time trying to run from you,
			But I'm, I'm out of my mind.</li>
